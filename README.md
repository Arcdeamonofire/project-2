# Technologies Used (API Reference?)
node.js, express, ejs, html, css, bootstrap and ejs-layouts, mongodb, mongo, and mongoose

# Approach
Created a user creation and authentication system first and created 3 models for user, posts, and comments. Linked the user and post models and the post and comment models together. Using the route paths of express created an app using CRUD (only have really done CR right now, but hoping to do at least U and maybe add admin privleges and create D as well). Then integrated bootstrap with an ejs-layout and used it to help style the page.

#Installation Instructions
None at the moment

# Unsolved Problems
css styling still feels unsufficticated and missing something, but haven't figured out/decided what. There may be an issue with the user sign up feature, but I'm going to need to do more testing to find out.
